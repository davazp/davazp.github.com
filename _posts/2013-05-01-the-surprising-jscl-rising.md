title: The surprising JSCL rising

I am just back from a few days of holidays and have seen how active
JSCL is!  It is really exciting.

This rising is due to [abeaumont](https://github.com/abeaumont)
probably. I stopped working, but he came up with an idea I liked. It
is, why don't integrate JSCL into [Conkeror](http://conkeror.org/)?
We would end up with a Lisp programmable browser... that's a practical
reason!  We did some tests locally and it seemed to work, but now it
is time for improving JSCL itself.

It is not the only platform where JSCL could run on. I plan to add
support for [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/). Indeed, it will let us use
the REPL and tests in the terminal in addition to the browser, which
is a much more convenient way to program.

In the meantime, I would like to improve the compiler a little bit.

Suggestion and patches are very welcome if you want to join us.
