  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    My name is David VÃ¡zquez, I am a student of Mathematics, free
    software enthusiast and programmer. I was born in Spain but I live
    in Ireland right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a student of Mathematics, I love pure math.. Algebra and Topology
    mostly. I try to get an easy and intuitive comprehension of the
    abstract concepts when possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a programmer, I enjoy writing code in
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
      Lisp</a> from
    my <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU/Emacs</a>, and I
    am lucky because I have a full-time job where I do it. I also like
    other languages, but no one as much :-).
