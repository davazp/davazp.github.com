Hello everybody. Here it is, a new github-hosted blog. You can know
something [about me](/about.html) now, but what will this blog be
about? Unsurprisingly, I will tell different things I hack, as the
main reason to open this blog is because I do not know many people to
talk about this kind of things face-to-face. You will find some Lisp
and Emacs-related posts probably, as well as some light math, but I
will post anything I find interesting.

The blog is quite simple. I do not provide tags yet, but I have
enabled comments on the posts, so you can give some feedback.

Finally, I hope to share some nice things, and somebody likes
it. Also, English is not my mother tongue, so writing it requires some
extra effort, but I will do my best.

Welcome to my blog.
