My name is David VÃ¡zquez, I studied Mathematics, and I am a free
software enthusiast and programmer. I was born in Spain, I lived in
Ireland for 2 years and now I am living in Amsterdam.

I love pure math.. Algebra and Topology mostly. I try to get an easy
and intuitive comprehension of the abstract concepts when possible.

As a programmer, I enjoy writing code in
[Common Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) from my
[GNU/Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
