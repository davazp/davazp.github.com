My name is David VÃ¡zquez, I studied Mathematics, and I am a free
software enthusiast and programmer. I was born in Spain, I lived in
Ireland for 2 years and since 2015 I am living in Amsterdam.

I love pure math... Algebra and Topology mostly. I try to get an easy
and intuitive comprehension of the abstract concepts when
possible. 

The same joy for understanding guides me a programmer. I have worked
in too many different things to list here. But perhaps the most
recurrent theme has been programming languages: *Common Lisp*,
*Forth*, *Javascript*, *Elixir*, *Haskell*... In my heart I will
always be a Lisper.
