I like old systems which expose a good part of their internals,
specially when they are so simple. I created this animation using
[ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) to illustrate how execution is
done in Forth:

Of course, it only makes sense if you already know Forth. But I guess
you do not know many languages where such thing is possible.
