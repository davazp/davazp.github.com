**UPDATE 22 Nov 2014: The project was renamed to *JSCL* and now is hosted at <http://github.com/davazp/jscl>. 
You can also try [the live demo](http://davazp.net/jscl/jscl.html).**

[Raimon Grau](http://puntoblogspot.blogspot.ie/) and I have been
working on a simple Lisp to Javascript compiler, in order to better
understand how to bootstrap it. Now we got it. It compiles itself and
the resulting code can be used from the browser. It can even call its
own internals, which is quite nice.

It is not very helpful, you can
[try it](http://davazp.github.com/ecmalisp/ecmalisp.html). Now I have
to think if it could be useful for something... maybe a live Lisp
tutorial, or make it suitable for Android. Any suggestions?

The repository with the whole history is at:
